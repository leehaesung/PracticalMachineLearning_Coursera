1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:02,442
One of the most important components of

2
00:00:02,442 --> 00:00:05,054
building a machine learning algorithm or
prediction model

3
00:00:05,054 --> 00:00:06,986
is understanding how the data actually
look

4
00:00:06,986 --> 00:00:08,880
and how the data interact with each other.

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,760
So, the best way to do that is actually

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,480
by plotting the data, in particular
plotting the predictors.

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,050
So for this example we're going to be
using this wages data.

8
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,570
So the wages data is actually data from
the ISLR package.

9
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,750
Which you can find at this link.

10
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,160
And it's from the book Introduction to
Statistical Learning.

11
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,503
So we're going to be looking at this data

12
00:00:27,503 --> 00:00:30,220
and seeing how we can use it for
prediction.

13
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:31,760
So if I load the ISLR package.

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,450
Again I'm going to have to install it
first and then I can load it.

15
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,280
And I also load the ggplot2 package
because

16
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,930
we're going to be using that for some
plotting.

17
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,370
And the caret package, because we're going
to be using that for model building.

18
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,510
The wage data is actually in the ISLR
package, and

19
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,610
I can load it with data and a capital w
Wage.

20
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,240
And then I can look at a summary of that
wage

21
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,250
data to look at all the different
variables that are in there.

22
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,250
So we have the year of the data that's
collected.

23
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:58,100
The age of the person who is the data is
collected on.

24
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,525
In this case, it's only male people in
this data set,

25
00:01:01,525 --> 00:01:06,116
the marital status of those people, their
race, education, the region where

26
00:01:06,116 --> 00:01:09,472
they were, the data was collected is just
the Mid Atlantic

27
00:01:09,472 --> 00:01:13,830
region, and then the different kinds of
job classes and their health.

28
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,960
So this gives you a little bit of
information about what

29
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,180
the type of data that we're going to be
looking at.

30
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,700
And you can already see that we've
detected a few interesting

31
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,700
characteristics of this data just by
looking at a summary here.

32
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,140
We know that they're all men.

33
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,290
We know that they're all in the Mid
Atlantic region, for example.

34
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,510
So then what we do is again, just like
always,

35
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,580
we're going to build a training set and a
test set.

36
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,584
Even before we do exploration, we're
going to set aside the

37
00:01:36,584 --> 00:01:39,221
testing set and we're not going to use it
for anything

38
00:01:39,221 --> 00:01:41,671
until we actually look at the data at the
end

39
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:46,200
of the, model building experience, and
apply it just one time.

40
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,720
So we're going to do all our plotting in
the training set.

41
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,580
So one example is to use this feature

42
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:54,470
plot, plot that comes from the caret
package.

43
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,860
So this plot will plot basically all of

44
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,490
the features against each other so this
plot

45
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:02,210
looks a little bit confusing for this data
so I thought I'd just go through it.

46
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:07,550
So here I'm, using as the outcome I'm
saying the outcome is the wage.

47
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,904
And then I'm going to look at all

48
00:02:08,904 --> 00:02:12,480
these different variables, age, education,
and job class.

49
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,072
So, first of all I have this y variable so
that's

50
00:02:15,072 --> 00:02:18,692
the outcome that we care about, and here
the different variables.

51
00:02:18,692 --> 00:02:23,208
I've got age, education, you can't read it
very clearly in this

52
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:27,216
plot, but if you make it yourself you can,
and job class here.

53
00:02:27,216 --> 00:02:30,804
And so, what this plot is, this is the
plot

54
00:02:30,804 --> 00:02:34,809
here of the outcome y versus the job class
here.

55
00:02:34,809 --> 00:02:40,258
So you can see, you can do that for every
box, so if you want to see the

56
00:02:40,258 --> 00:02:46,430
plot of job class versus education, that's
this plot here.

57
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,420
And it's the same plot here, only with the
axis reversed and so forth.

58
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,030
So it shows you all of the variables that
you have here, plotted against each other.

59
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,978
And in particular, what you are looking
for, here are all the

60
00:02:55,978 --> 00:03:00,160
plots corresponding to each of the
variables plotted versus the y variable.

61
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,680
And you're looking for any variable that
seems

62
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,160
to show a relationship with the y
variable.

63
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,457
So, for example, you can see that there
seems to

64
00:03:06,457 --> 00:03:09,330
be a trend here between education and
salary, for example.

65
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,540
So this is one way that you can look at
all the data.

66
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,200
Another thing that you're going to use is
either Qplot, function

67
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,440
in the ggplot2 package or just the plot
function base R.

68
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,995
So here I'm plotting age versus wage, and
so you can see again it

69
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:26,710
appears that there seems to be some kind
of trend with age and wages.

70
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,357
But you also see, one thing that

71
00:03:28,357 --> 00:03:31,510
you notice frequently from making plots
like this.

72
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,160
Here's some very strange patterns.

73
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,723
So you see there's this big chunk up here
of observations that

74
00:03:36,723 --> 00:03:41,260
appear to be very different than the
relationship down here for these chunks.

75
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,400
So one thing that we might want to do is
try to figure out why

76
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,720
there, there's that strange relation
between ages

77
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,480
and wages before we build our, our model.

78
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,886
So, one thing that we could do is, for
example,

79
00:03:51,886 --> 00:03:55,430
using the ggplot2 package, color that plot
by different variables.

80
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:01,130
So again, I plotted age versus wage, so on
the x axis is age, on the y axis is wage.

81
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,770
But now I've colored it by the job class.

82
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,150
And so you can do that with, by

83
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,290
passing the parameter color to the two
plot function.

84
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,826
And so what you see now is that most of
the individuals that are up

85
00:04:11,826 --> 00:04:15,029
in this other chunk, come from the
information

86
00:04:15,029 --> 00:04:18,240
based jobs as opposed to the industrial
jobs.

87
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,680
So that might explain a lot of the

88
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,200
difference here between, these two big
classes of observations.

89
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,840
So this gives you a way to sort of

90
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,560
detect variables that might be important
in your model.

91
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,150
Because they show, variation in the data.

92
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,810
So you can also add regression smoothers.

93
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,210
So, for example, now, what I've done is,
I've again made a

94
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:43,510
plot of age versus wage, but now I've
colored it by education.

95
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,580
And so then what I can do is I can use

96
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:51,220
the geom_smooth function to apply a linear
smoother to the data.

97
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,382
You would've learned about this in
Exploratory Data Analysis, but

98
00:04:54,382 --> 00:04:57,360
if not, you can just see the function
right here.

99
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,880
And so what that does is for every
different education class, it

100
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,900
fits a linear model, so you can see
there's a purple line here.

101
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,120
And that corresponds to people with
advanced degrees and then you can see for

102
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,670
example a green line here, that
corresponds

103
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,120
to people with some college and so forth.

104
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,030
And so you can see if there's a different
relationship for different age groups.

105
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,297
The other thing that you might that is

106
00:05:19,297 --> 00:05:21,579
often very useful is to break up things
like

107
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:24,832
the wage variable into different
categories cause sometimes it's

108
00:05:24,832 --> 00:05:28,670
clear that specific categories seem to
have different relationships.

109
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:33,230
The way I tend to do that is with the cut2
function, that's in the Hmisc package.

110
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:37,134
So if you load the Hmisc package and then
use cut2, you can tell

111
00:05:37,134 --> 00:05:41,670
it with the g parameter how many groups to
break the data set into.

112
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:45,910
And it'll break the data set up into
factors based on quantile groups.

113
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:49,355
So all of the observations that land
between 20.1 and

114
00:05:49,355 --> 00:05:52,657
91.7 on the wage variable will get
assigned to this

115
00:05:52,657 --> 00:05:56,103
factor level and then all the values
between 91.7 and

116
00:05:56,103 --> 00:06:00,060
118.9 will get assigned to this group and
so forth.

117
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,210
And so, what you can do now is you can
actually

118
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,330
use that to, in order to make different
kinds of plots.

119
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:09,875
So now, suppose I wanted to plot wage
versus, oh sorry, wage groups versus

120
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:16,060
age, I can now, use qplot again but now I
can pass it the box plot geometry.

121
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:20,530
And then I can say okay, I want to see the
plot of these different wage groups

122
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,800
versus age and sometimes that can make it

123
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,190
easier to see different trends that are
emerging.

124
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,140
For example, you can see here a little

125
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:30,130
bit more clearly the relationship between
age and wage.

126
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,500
The other thing you might want to do is
you might want

127
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,990
to add on top of the box plots, actually
the points themselves.

128
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,360
The reason why you might want to do

129
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,750
this is because sometimes box plots can
obscure how

130
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:45,080
many points are being shown here and so
one thing that you can do is you can

131
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:51,040
say, pass it both box plot and jitter and
you can have it, arrange the plot so you

132
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:56,230
can see both the box plot itself and you
can see the box plot with points overlaid.

133
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:00,690
So that's what grid arrange is doing, it's
actually generating the two plots.

134
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,270
So p1 was the plot that we made on the
previous slide.

135
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:06,160
And p2 is the plot we made here with
points overlaid.

136
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,280
And grid arrange makes two plots side by
side.

137
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,066
So you can see here from the dots that
there's a large number of dots in each of

138
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,493
the different boxes and so that suggest
that this

139
00:07:15,493 --> 00:07:18,200
trend, any trend a user may actually be
real.

140
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,285
If you observe just one of a few dots in
the boxes it means maybe

141
00:07:21,285 --> 00:07:23,403
that that particular box isn't very well

142
00:07:23,403 --> 00:07:27,170
representative of what the data actually
looked like.

143
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:30,310
Another thing that's very useful is you
can use the cut variable,

144
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:34,420
the factorized version of the continuous
variable to look at tables of data.

145
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,742
So here I'm making a table comparing this
factor

146
00:07:37,742 --> 00:07:40,416
version of wages to the job class and so I

147
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:44,144
can see for example that there are more
industrial jobs

148
00:07:44,144 --> 00:07:48,880
in the lower wage variable than there are
information jobs.

149
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,080
And that trend reverses itself for the
highway jobs.

150
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,390
There are fewer industrial people and more
information people.

151
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:59,330
You can also use prop table to actually
get the proportions in each group.

152
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,581
So here it's the proportion, by passing it
one,

153
00:08:02,581 --> 00:08:05,700
I say I want to get the proportion in each
row.

154
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:10,960
So if I passed it at two here, it would
give me the proportion in each column.

155
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,370
So here I see that 62% of the low wage

156
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:17,870
jobs go, correspond to industrial, and
37%, 38% correspond to information.

157
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,720
And so you can use that to get an

158
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,550
idea of how those proportions change
across different wage levels.

159
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,570
Finally you can use density plots to plot
the values of continuous predictors.

160
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:31,100
So here again I'm using the qplot
function.

161
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:36,020
I'm plotting the wage variable, and I'm
plotting a density plot, versus education.

162
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,330
So this basically shows where the bulk of
the data is.

163
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,620
So on the x axis is the wage.

164
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,500
And on the y axis is sort of the
proportion of

165
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,850
the variable that falls into that bin of
the x axis.

166
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:51,861
And so you can see, for example, the high
school grads tend to have more values that

167
00:08:51,861 --> 00:08:53,689
are down here in the lower part of

168
00:08:53,689 --> 00:08:56,467
the range, and the advanced degree folks
tend to

169
00:08:56,467 --> 00:09:01,344
be a little bit higher, and there's also a
group, outgroup over here that tends to be

170
00:09:01,344 --> 00:09:04,189
very high for both the advanced degree as
well

171
00:09:04,189 --> 00:09:06,740
as the college grads which is shown in
blue.

172
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:11,460
So sometimes density plots can show things
that box plots can't necessarily do.

173
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,112
It's also easier to overlay multiple

174
00:09:13,112 --> 00:09:15,680
distributions when you're doing density
plots.

175
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,500
In other words, if you break things up
into a bunch of different groups, and you

176
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,410
want to see how all the distributions
change

177
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:24,280
by group, density plots can be very
useful.

178
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,960
So, one thing to keep in mind is to make
your plots only in the training data.

179
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,220
The test set, again, can't be used for
exploration.

180
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,730
That would be similar to training your
model on the test

181
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:37,650
set, which, as we should, talked about
previously, will lead to overfitting.

182
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,020
Things that you should be looking for in
these

183
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,550
plots is imbalance in the outcomes of the
predictors.

184
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,610
If you see all of the predictors tend to
be one

185
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:48,260
value in the one outcome group, and not
another outcome group.

186
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,690
Then you see that's a good predictor.

187
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:54,402
But if you see that, you only have three
of one outcome and 150 of the other

188
00:09:54,402 --> 00:09:56,606
outcome, that means it's going to be very
hard

189
00:09:56,606 --> 00:09:59,580
to build an accurate classifier between
those two classes.

190
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,601
You're looking for outliers or weird
groups outlying the data

191
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:06,340
that might suggest that there are some
variables you're missing.

192
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:09,950
And groups of points that are not
explained by any of the predictors.

193
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,180
Skewed variables which you're going to
want to transform and

194
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,810
make look better, more sort of nicely
normally distributed if you're

195
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:19,530
using things like regression models but
that may not matter

196
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:22,490
as much as if you're using more of machine
learning methods.

197
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,330
For more information on plotting in
general

198
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,060
you can look at the ggplot2 tutorial.

199
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,769
You could also take the exploratory data
analysis class in

200
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:32,312
this data science specialization or you
can look at the

201
00:10:32,312 --> 00:10:35,631
caret visualization tutorial, because
that'll give you a little bit

202
00:10:35,631 --> 00:10:39,080
more information about prediction specific
plots that might be useful.
